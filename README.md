# Good_Auditor_Agent
A multi-agent AI system that provides professional audit consultation based on ISO 19011:2018 standards.

## What This Does

This program creates three AI agents that work together to help you with audit questions:
- **Senior Auditor**: Provides expert guidance
- **Compliance Officer**: Ensures ISO 19011:2018 compliance
- **Report Writer**: Creates professional audit reports

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.8+** installed on your computer
2. **OpenAI API Key** (you need to get this from OpenAI)

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Install Required Packages

Open your terminal/command prompt and run:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv autogen-agentchat autogen-ext
```

### Step 2: Get Your OpenAI API Key

1. Go to [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Create an account or log in
3. Go to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key (it looks like: `sk-...`)

### Step 3: Create Environment File

1. In the same folder as `main.py`, create a new file called `.env`
2. Open the `.env` file and add your API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
```

**Important**: Replace `sk-your-actual-api-key-here` with your real API key!

### Step 4: Run the Program

In your terminal, navigate to the project folder and run:

```bash
python main.py
```

## How to Use

### Interactive Mode (Default)

When you run the program, you'll see:

```
======================================================================
GOOD AUDITOR AGENT - ISO 19011:2018 Expert System
======================================================================

Commands: 'quit'/'exit' to stop, 'clear' for new session

üîç Audit Question: 
```

**What to do:**
1. Type your audit question and press Enter
2. Wait for the AI agents to discuss and provide answers
3. Type another question or use commands:
   - `quit` or `exit` - Stop the program
   - `clear` - Start a fresh conversation

### Example Questions You Can Ask

- "How do I plan a risk-based audit for ISO 9001?"
- "What documentation do I need for an internal audit?"
- "How should I handle non-conformities during an audit?"
- "What are the key principles of ISO 19011:2018?"

### Example Mode

To run with a pre-built example question, change this line in `main.py`:

```python
asyncio.run(main(interactive=False))  # Change True to False
```

## Configuration Options

You can modify settings in the `Config` class:

```python
@dataclass
class Config:
    model: str = "gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07"  # AI model to use
    max_msg: int = 6                       # Max messages per discussion
    max_turn: int = 2                      # Max conversation rounds
```

## Troubleshooting

### "OPENAI_API_KEY required" Error
- Make sure your `.env` file exists
- Check that your API key is correct
- Ensure there are no extra spaces in the `.env` file

### Import Errors
- Run `pip install python-dotenv autogen-agentchat autogen-ext` again
- Make sure you're using Python 3.8 or newer

### Connection Errors
- Check your internet connection
- Verify your OpenAI API key is valid and has credits

```

## What Each Part Does

- **Config**: Stores settings and loads your API key
